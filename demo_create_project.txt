title :   WHAT'S THIS PROJECT ALL ABOUT? 
i
content : The Farm Family Project, will be a book of 42 photographs of farm animal portraiture I've taken over the last 15 years. My name is Rob MacInnis, and I hope to produce a hardcover full-color monograph, published by YOU. In addition to full page color photographs, I’m excited to share that the book will feature an introduction by the director of Monster and Wonder Woman, my friend and a supporter of my work, the amazing Patty Jenkins!
content : My photography has been featured in museums, art galleries and magazines across the world, and one image has even had a life of its own as a viral meme, but I have never published a book of my photographs. With your help, that is about to change. It’s time to get the gang together and present this series as a book, and put that book into your hands! With your name in the acknowledgements!
title :   STRETCH GOAL ONE: $36,000 - NEW FEATURES - GOAL REACHED!!
content : We are so close to this goal, and it would improve the book significantly. If we get to $36,500, we can afford to pay for an even higher-grade paper, a luxurious cloth for the cover, a ribbon bookmark and a colored headband, a subtle but beautiful feature (see pics below)

content : If we reach this goal, we will be able to add more pages to the book, including three more photographs which we were not previously able to include. The gatefold is something that I really wanted to include in the original book, but I did not expect to be able to afford it. It’s a bit expensive, but if our budget can be raised to $44,000 we can add a fold-out panorama in the center of the book of my panoramic photograph of 80 animals standing together.
content : Your card will only be charged when the book reaches its funding deadline. The book is expected to be published immediately following the kickstarter and will take about six weeks to print, shipping to you shortly afterwards. The prints and postcards will be shipped soon after the completion of the campaign.
